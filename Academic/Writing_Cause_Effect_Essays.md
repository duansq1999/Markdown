## Cause/Effect Essays

### What's Cause/Effect?

- *Cause* means *what makes something happen*. A synonym is reason.
- *Effect* means *what happens as as result*.
- When you write this essay, you need to focus on either causes or effects, not both!

## Before You Write

- Think about your topic
- Make a plan
