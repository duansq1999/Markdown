In this lesson, we'll see how to extract elements from a vector based on some conditions that we specify.

For example, we may only be interested in the first 20 elements of a vector, or only the elements that are not NA, or only those that are positive or correspond to a specific variable of interest. By the end of this lesson, you'll know how to handle each of these scenarios.
