## Introduce

Control structures in R allow you to control the flow of execution of the program, depending on runtime conditions. Common structures are

- `if, else` : testing a condition
- `for` : execute a loop a **fixed** number of times
- `while` : execute a loop while **condition is true**
- `repeat` : execute an infinite loop
- `break` : break the execution of a loop
- `next` : skip an interation of a loop
- `return` : exit a function
